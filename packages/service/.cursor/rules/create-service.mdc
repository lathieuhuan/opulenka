Steps to make a new service in packages/service/src.

For example: AccountService

1. Create the repository interface:

- Directory: src/interfaces/repositories
- Define IAccountRepository interface that AccountService will interact with.
- Example: `account-repository.ts`

2. Define interfaces for service methods:

- Directory: src/interfaces/services
- Define request and response interfaces for each method AccountService will expose.
- Example: `account-service.ts`

3. Implement the Repository class:

- Directory: src/repositories
- Create AccountRepository class that implements IAccountRepository interface.
- Example: `account-repository.ts`

3. Implement the Service class:

- Directory: src/services
- Create AccountService class with methods for each service operation. The class uses the IAccountRepository that is injected through its constructor to perform database operations.
- If there should be any error, define it in src/services/errors. Example: `account-errors.ts`
- Use decorator @CatchErrors to handle exceptions in each service methods.
- Example: `account-service.ts`

5. Integrate with Service Provider:

- Update the `service-provider.ts` to include AccountService.
